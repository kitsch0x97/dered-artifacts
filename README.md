# Anonymous Submission - Artifacts Repository

This repository contains the datasets and source code for the paper *"DeRed: Enhancing Third Party Library Reuse Detection via Deceptive Reuse Elimination"*. Our system, **DeRed**, consists of three main modules—*Function Matching*, *Area Alignment*, and *Reuse Discrimination*—as shown in the figure below. Given a target binary $B_{\mathrm{tgt}}$ and a candidate binary $B_{\mathrm{cdd}}$, the system analyzes their relationships to identify genuine reuse and eliminate deceptive reuse cases.
